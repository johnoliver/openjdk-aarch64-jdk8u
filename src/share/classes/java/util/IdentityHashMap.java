/**
 * This class implements the <tt>Map</tt> interface with a hash table, using
 * reference-equality in place of object-equality when comparing keys (and
 * values).  In other words, in an <tt>IdentityHashMap</tt>, two keys
 * <tt>k1</tt> and <tt>k2</tt> are considered equal if and only if
 * <tt>(k1==k2)</tt>.  (In normal <tt>Map</tt> implementations (like
 * <tt>HashMap</tt>) two keys <tt>k1</tt> and <tt>k2</tt> are considered equal
 * if and only if <tt>(k1==null ? k2==null : k1.equals(k2))</tt>.)
 *
 * <p><b>This class is <i>not</i> a general-purpose <tt>Map</tt>
 * implementation!  While this class implements the <tt>Map</tt> interface, it
 * intentionally violates <tt>Map's</tt> general contract, which mandates the
 * use of the <tt>equals</tt> method when comparing objects.  This class is
 * designed for use only in the rare cases wherein reference-equality
 * semantics are required.</b>
 *
 * <p>A typical use of this class is <i>topology-preserving object graph
 * transformations</i>, such as serialization or deep-copying.  To perform such
 * a transformation, a program must maintain a "node table" that keeps track
 * of all the object references that have already been processed.  The node
 * table must not equate distinct objects even if they happen to be equal.
 * Another typical use of this class is to maintain <i>proxy objects</i>.  For
 * example, a debugging facility might wish to maintain a proxy object for
 * each object in the program being debugged.
 *
 * <p>This class provides all of the optional map operations, and permits
 * <tt>null</tt> values and the <tt>null</tt> key.  This class makes no
 * guarantees as to the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee
 * that the order will remain constant over time.
 *
 * <p>This class provides constant-time performance for the basic
 * operations (<tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>), assuming the system
 * identity hash function ({@link System#identityHashCode(Object)})
 * disperses elements properly among the buckets.
 *
 * <p>This class has one tuning parameter (which affects performance but not
 * semantics): <i>expected maximum size</i>.  This parameter is the maximum
 * number of key-value mappings that the map is expected to hold.  Internally,
 * this parameter is used to determine the number of buckets initially
 * comprising the hash table.  The precise relationship between the expected
 * maximum size and the number of buckets is unspecified.
 *
 * <p>If the size of the map (the number of key-value mappings) sufficiently
 * exceeds the expected maximum size, the number of buckets is increased
 * Increasing the number of buckets ("rehashing") may be fairly expensive, so
 * it pays to create identity hash maps with a sufficiently large expected
 * maximum size.  On the other hand, iteration over collection views requires
 * time proportional to the number of buckets in the hash table, so it
 * pays not to set the expected maximum size too high if you are especially
 * concerned with iteration performance or memory usage.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access an identity hash map concurrently, and at
 * least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it <i>must</i>
 * be synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is any operation
 * that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value
 * associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a
 * structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished by
 * synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.
 *
 * If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap}
 * method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 * unsynchronized access to the map:<pre>
 *   Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new IdentityHashMap(...));</pre>
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by the <tt>iterator</tt> method of the
 * collections returned by all of this class's "collection view
 * methods" are <i>fail-fast</i>: if the map is structurally modified
 * at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except
 * through the iterator's own <tt>remove</tt> method, the iterator
 * will throw a {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the
 * face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and
 * cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior
 * at an undetermined time in the future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness: <i>fail-fast iterators should be used only
 * to detect bugs.</i>
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: This is a simple <i>linear-probe</i> hash table,
 * as described for example in texts by Sedgewick and Knuth.  The array
 * alternates holding keys and values.  (This has better locality for large
 * tables than does using separate arrays.)  For many JRE implementations
 * and operation mixes, this class will yield better performance than
 * {@link HashMap} (which uses <i>chaining</i> rather than linear-probing).
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
